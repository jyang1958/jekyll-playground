# Experiment With Jekyll Include
Here is where we will attempt using two markdown files that have two headings with exact the same text. Normally the text is generated along with an id, but if the text is the same, and there has to be an unique id, **what happens?**

{% include LivingProgram/2016/03/10/test1.md %}
{% include LivingProgram/2016/03/10/test2.md %}
