# [The Almond Tree](http://thealmondtreebook.com/)

> The Almond Tree is an epic novel, a drama of the proportions of the Kite Runner, but set in Palestine. A story that grabs you from the first page and makes your heart go out to the Palestinians without pointing fingers at anyone. This novel is not a political lecture, but a gripping and compassionate work of fiction

## About the book

The unforgettable story of a young Palestinian boy whose mathematical gifts allow him to escape the difficulties of life as an Arab Israeli, The Almond Tree is a beautifully crafted debut novel written by a Jewish American woman from the perspective of a Palestinian Muslim male. It is about the power of love, the price of hatred, and the possibility of redemption.

## About the author

> Michelle Corasanti’s debut novel brings to us a heart rending story of courage and resilience. The Almond Tree is undoubtedly one of the best books I’ve read this year. I feel that she brings a touch of gentleness and compassion in her stories which leaves the reader with an ache in the heart.

Michelle Cohen Corasanti grew up in a Jewish home in which German cars were boycotted and Israeli bonds were plentiful. Other than the blue-and-white tin Jewish National Fund sedakah box her family kept in the kitchen and the money they would give to plant trees in Israel, all she learned growing up was that after the Holocaust, the Jews found a land without a people for a people without a land and made the desert bloom.
