# Single Page Prototypes with Jekyll Front Matter

In this lesson we learn how to make single page prototypes with [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

## Blank Page
Here is a [blank page](https://bigdata-mindstorms.github.io/jekyll-playground/public/ontouchstart/2016/04/19/blank.html).
The source you can view in the browser is following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
which is almost exactly like [our source](blank.html) except the empty [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)

```
