This is a [web page](http://bigdata-mindstorms.github.io/jekyll-playground/public/ontouchstart/2016/03/07/index.html) generated from these two files

- [_layouts/ontouchstart/2016/03/07/default.html](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/jekyll-playground/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/ontouchstart/2016/03/07/default.html)
- [public/ontouchstart/2016/03/07/index.md](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/jekyll-playground/blob/gh-pages/public/ontouchstart/2016/03/07/index.md)

Pay attention to the naming convention of all the files involved.

- In the [Frontmatter](http://jekyll.bootcss.com/docs/frontmatter/) part, the `layout` attribute is the __relative path__ of the layout file in the `_layouts` folder, without the file name extension.
- The source code has the `.md` extension.
- The final webpage has `.html` extension.
